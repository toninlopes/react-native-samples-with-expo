The target of this project is to test some good practice, patterns, and samples.

## Composition Pattern to apply in reusable Components

In "traditional component architecture", it is common to encounter the need for passing numerous props throughout the component tree to incorporate custom styles or behaviours.

The Composition Pattern comes to the rescue to simplify these concerns.

There is an example of it on ``__components__/Item`` folder.
